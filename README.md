# Maze-solver-using-Arduino
Solves a maze by reaching to its end via shortest path. The bot uses two chances.
1.	(First chance): The robot finds its way out from a maze means it reaches to endpoint.
2.	(Second chance): After finding the solution to the maze, it optimise its solution finding the shortest path from start to finish.
