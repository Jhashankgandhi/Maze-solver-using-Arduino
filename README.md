# Maze-solver-using-Arduino
Solves a maze by reaching to its end via shortest path. The bot uses two chances.
1.	(First chance):  The robot finds its way out from a maze means it reaches to endpoint.
2.	(Second chance): After finding the solution to the maze, it optimise its solution finding the shortest path from start to finish.

1. Arduino Uno
2. Two DC Motors
3. Three IR sensors
4. L293D Motor Driver IC
5. Jumper wires
6. Metallic Chassis
7. Breadboard
8. Arduino IDE
